# ResNET-Implementation

Ive implemented a 50 layer deep Residual Network to identify the number signified by hand gestures which is one-hot encoded. Ive have used Keras and Tensoflow to implement the following.

This network has many advantages over an average deep neural network especially when it comes to vanishing gradients. The problem of vanishing gradients is completely avoided with this implementation due to the skip connections which address the issue.

The identity block and the convolutional block further make it easy to implement this model. 

Feel free to clone the following code and use them on your own dataset.
